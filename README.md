# Parcel Delivery Service Routing System

## Description
The Parcel Delivery Service is a robust and dynamic package delivery system designed to optimize daily local deliveries (DLD) in metropolitan areas, starting with Salt Lake City. Leveraging advanced algorithms and efficient data handling, the system ensures all packages are delivered on time, fulfilling the promise of reliability and speed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitors the progress of each delivery truck and package, providing updates on delivery status and time.
- **Adaptable Delivery Scheduling**: Accommodates on-the-fly changes in package delivery requirements and deadlines.
- **Optimized for Scale**: Designed to be replicated across multiple cities and states, ensuring a broad operational presence is supported.
- **Comprehensive Data Parsing**: Reads and processes data from CSV files containing location coordinates and distances, fully automated to reduce human error.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Written in Python, the system follows OOP principles for modular, maintainable, and scalable code.
